# Docker-compose

Available as [lloydmeta/docker-compose:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/lloydmeta/docker-compose/)

Super simple version of [docker-compose](https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/compose/) that doesn't have an entrypoint. Useful for Gitlab CI which assumes it can issue commands without overriding entrypoint.

Oh, it also has the docker command.
